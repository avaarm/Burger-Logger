## Description 

Burger-Logger is a command-line-interface (CLI) application that allows a user to the type of burger they want to eat, in other words it is a burger eating or ordering system, where the data is saved in the MySQL databse. The user will be allowed to input information about the team member such as title and employee ID. 

This project has helped me gain a better understanding of MVC- model, view, and control - paradigm ad well as databases, particualrly the use of MySQL. Additionally, I was also able to explore and gain a better understanding of express.
